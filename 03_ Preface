I'm a child of the 1980s, at school I was taught the philosophy 'hard work pays', while at home I watched on the TV, hard working men being beaten by police. From an early age I saw the contradiction in the system. I went on to root for the Labour party in the 1987 election, as they seem truer to my school's philosophy and dealt with the disappointment.

I would have believed in capitalism, if only capitalism worked, instead of being a vague image of an politic/economy, ignoring the bad side effects as 'externalities'. My teenage years were consumed by the only future for humanity I saw, an apocalypse and obsessively watched the film 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' in preparation. As the years went by and the apocalypse hadn't arrived, I became more active in finding solutions to avert it. I've since flirted with all manor of ideologies, looking for the one which would bring about a heaven on earth, but didn't find a viable one.

So I've decided over a decade ago to create one myself. Fortunately the first attempt was a catastrophic failure of a thought experiment, which has enabled me to be able to devote all my time to this current philosophy. As well complementary side projects which have fed back into my thinking and loosened my ideals with practice. With the failure of first thought experiment went the hope for a simple centralised solution. I abandoned the first philosophy but kept the manifesto title, and a few years later the name Nexusism came to me. I do love the name nexusism, as it's both a humours pun on what is required to supersede capitalism and fits the ideology.

With the crash of 2008 and economic stagnation that has followed, the majorities of people's fixed notion of capitalism as a static fixture of economic reality that lasts for time immemorial shattered, which has made the job of discussing alternatives easier. Along with unsolved economic crises, there are political, social and ecological crises that encompass humanity, with ever increasing urgency as their threat increases. All this has increased the pressure on me to finish this ideology, but I'd rather be taking beautiful pictures of the world, LOL!!!

With the coincidence of personal tragedy, which brought home the fragility of life, and the release of Paul Mason's book 'PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future', I realised the time for this ideology was now. I had to read though quickly Paul Mason's aforementioned book as I thought he may have beat me to the punch, but found it to be nothing but a great prologue. I do recommend you read Paul Mason's book if you need the justifications behind what I assert in this manifesto, a great foundational read maybe along with other books Amazon says 'Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought'. 

I don't compare myself to Marx, as he was a trouble-maker and knew his ideology was not the answer but didn't want capitalism go unopposed. I on the other hand aim to be a trouble-shooter, a super-sharp-shooter if you will, there's enough trouble in the world. 

This manifesto was a 12 year battle with dylexia.
