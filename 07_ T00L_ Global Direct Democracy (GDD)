We're not going anywhere as a planet unless we go there together. Global Direct Democracy (GDD) with the help of a open trustless computer network will enable humanity to decide on important dicisions that affect us all. With the help of DIVNA or AUHA systems for authentication, we can vote on matters that affect us all and come to a global consensus for action. I propose the threshold for a decision would be a two thirds majority, continuously run and a decision is set after a period of stability in the majority, contentiously run as an opinion of the decision and id they're a stable two thirds majority the other way the decision is reversed.
