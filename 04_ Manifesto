Networks have existed from the dawn of the universe, building structure and enabling processes with an ever increasing complexity. This has constructed a rich and diverse matrix, which has given us life and our own complexity. Our complexity now is creating it's own complexity (this is only recursive). It is easy to focus on our nexus (the things to which we have connections) and detach ourselves from the whole, but the whole is incomplete without you. Our existence is in crisis. The paths we have chosen have lead us to doom. For centuries (if not millennia) sensitive souls have warned us, but our addictions are too strong and our lives too short. We are all the same, expressed in different ways.

The main premise of this ideology is that nexus will supersede capital. An individual's nexus is their primary source of wealth, from which all other wealths are derived. Being connected to the right knowledge, skills, experience, research and people, generates a formidable nexus. My intention with nexusism is to cut an ideology with the grain of the soul, as I believe materialism is exhausted and at a dead end with a neo-liberalism/horizontalism post-modernist headlock. Spiritualism under utilised and whether you believe in the existence of your soul or not, it's conceptually our most important possession. Spiritualism offers an understanding that there is nothing but beings, entities and relationships between.

Nexusism is a framework and a roadmap for the political and economic development of the Free and Open Revolution (FOR). The FOR has emerged, evolved and grown underneath the global dominance of neo-liberalism. The FOR has created a indispensable non-market within capitalism, most distinctively in Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) such as Linux, Apache and OpenOffice, and also in the sharings like wikis (fast free and open collaboration), such as Wikipedia, Git and OpenStreetMap, as well as a whole multitude of non-market local community initiatives. The FOR is a benign revolution to capitalism, providing desired cost savings. For any ideology to create a paradigm shift, the ingredients that it accentuates within it's combinations have to exist prior. For nexusism they do. The FOR will continue giving capitalism a free & open lunch, but as capitalists' like to say "there's no such thing as a free lunch" ;)



The Bankruptcy of Individualism and Resurgence of Collectivism
==============================================================

In nexusism, I could be completely wrong and what capitalism and humanity needs is popularism; an aggressive reactionary democratic socialism to redistribute misallocated capital and have essential services and monopolies under state control in a tumultuous reset of capitalism, or a post-modern fascism to extend the pretence that everything is fine, while everything turns to dust and the world's population squabbles in a blackhole of hate. Obviously I'm being sarcastic here, but these are serious risks to our future as there is currently no alternative to the mainstreaming of political regressiveness. 

A paradox in socialism is it's all about the power of society but it must be implemented by the state. Nexusism is granular and is at home in isolation as it is in an organisation. Although the solution to our problems may be solved by progressive socialism, as neolibralism has made the workforce weak and corporate taxes low, making profits easier and the capitalist class lethargic. I'm sure there are at least a few capitalists absolutely bored at how easy it is for them to make money. Socialism could make the business environment more adverse and provide capitalists with a greater sense of achievement and vigour.

Galling atrocities and restless living nightmare, aside there is a rational argument for fascism. Looking at post-fascist Germany and Japan, they are much more tolerant, stable and peaceful, humbled and shamed of following their insecure impotent demagogues. Maybe if the USA and Britain embarked upon this fascist aversion therapy, one they'd have to leap off their pompous self-aggrandised 'world saviour' pedestals that have for along time been abused with misguided foreign policies, and would become more balanced and constructive world players. I'm not actually advocating this, but with the rise of fascists and crypto-fascists in the west, there is a risk that this would be a path. I would caution that there possibly wouldn't be a path back for humanity and civilisation would disintegrate never to return or be bound so tight that innovation would wither and the solutions that need to be created for us to survive further on this planet would not come into existence.

All these ideologies surround the same problems from different sides, issue to social cohesion is solutions aimed at the problems harm the other sides. Nexusism aims to be a framework that is applicable in all situations with minimal of disruption to practices.

Obviously politics is about power, there is left and right, left tends towards empowering everyone, where as the right tends to the retention power. A more interesting clarification is between progressive and reactionary, either go forward into the future or try to get back to a misty-eyed past. The further we progress into our networked future the more archaic all these concepts become. In Britain, the right has a traceable lineage all the way back the to English Civil War, where as the left has a broken lineage from whiggism, superseded by liberalism, superseded by socialism, superseded by a contemporary defused array of movements (environmental, civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ+, social justice, economic justice, etc). Each left-wing ideology having their success, run out of steam and getting overtaken by a more progressive agenda.



The Bitcoin-like and Capitalism's Last Boom
===========================================

You know when an ideology is at a dead end when all it's culture has to present as a vision of the future is systemic dystopias. Neo-liberalism has steered into this dystopian skid with financial extremism which has hollowed out the heart of the real economy and the global economy is forecast to be in the doldrums for the next fifty years. 

There are rays of brilliant light from decentralising technologies from the FOR's decentralised crypto movement, Bitcoin being one of the most prominent ones and Maidsafe's SAFE Network, Ethereum, Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), BitTorrent and 3D printing must receive an honourable mention, and resting on GNU/Linux and the whole Open Source ecosystem and who could forget the ancestor of them all, the internet. Increasingly tech teenagers are able to become bedroom billionaires, as the cost of starting and scaling an online business falls to near zero, decreasing the imperative of raising capital.

There is an economic boom available in these technologies, however they would dissipate the power of capital and automate jobs away. Information is exchanged at near zero marginal cost, which is corrosive to all other trades, the more the trade relies on information the greater the corrosion. A great deal of wealth is being generated by the hybridisation of decentralised crypto tech and stayed systems. Extra profitability coming from the reduction in costs by using decentralised crypto tech to automate expensive specialist white-collar jobs. Also the sharings are proving a rich resource further reducing costs.



Whole Value Capture
===================

Not everything has a price but everything has a value. We have a ruling ideology that thinks the bank account network represents true network value. Most people only captures value from capitalism through the allotted hours they work, where nexusism aims to capture and represent value from all parts of life. I propose the Open Value Matrix (OVM) to collect an evaluation of the relationship between defined entities with a system elected algorithm to assign a matrix value to each entity and from that assign currency. I call this 'democratic relativism' where the subjective relations people have (undependable in isolation) lead to structured matrix of the entirety of existence, where an element or entity can be isolated an assigned a value.

This would distribute capital among nexuses according to the algorithm to further encourage personal development and striving within an environment where paid work is becoming more and more scarce. I'd argue there's nothing wrong with the lust for power, wealth and social standing, it's as old as the hills. What is wrong is that it's currently achieved through a system of domination, where if you want those things you have to dominate. The all-time greats of humanity aren't dominant, their power is influence. We need to transition to a system of influence, an accounting system for influence. Along with a Basic Income (BI) from the state to it's citizens, OVM would supplement with wealth the system captures and more direct distribution of funds philanthropists would specifically target.

In an infinite universe there are infinite perspectives, to map them all we need infinite views. Many people with multiple perspectives of the same subject turn to be individuals of contradictions and struggle in a world which promotes absolutes. A reason why we need a system like OVM, is to show an individual how a 'foreign' entity is related back to them. Everything is connected, not just being a fantastic drug feeling, it is literally true. Independence is a political illusion, there is only interdependence. This is not currently openly expressed by our current system, but it's expression is a core theme of nexusism.

At some point in our future the Singularity will come into being and we don't want that to happen without us having a clear set of values for the Singularity to observe, if we have a fragmented value system, I perceive it would cause confusion, turmoil and contradictions.

Capitalism is a system that creates order from suppression of undesired insurgency and chaos by denial of capital to fund the growth of those practices. Nexusism on the other hand is a system that is free and open to all, suppressing undesired insurgency and chaos by inherent democracy that saps growth from contentious practices.



Other T00Ls of Nexusism
=======================

In following chapters there are T00Ls that interplay and will be developed to free, open and decentralised, using a choice of existing decentralised crypto tech.



Nexusism flag
=============

All groupings need their identity. I've a proposed flag to represent nexusism for occasions. It involves four colours; red, green, purple and black. Blood red representing life and passion. Foliage Green representing the eco-system and knowledge. Regal Purple representing power and control. Jet Black representing the unfathomable depths of our souls and the unknown. 

It contains symbolism of influencing ideologies. Red of the people and society, notably socialism; green of looking after the environment and the environmental movement; purple of the near continuity of wealth, power and social standing; black of the unkowable spirit realm, chaos and unordered; green and purple of the suffrage; red and black of anarchism; red and purple of the top and bottom of pride.

Capital will become faded grandeur like feudal power did in the period during the birth of Capitalism and it's early centuries, at an unknowable rate, as nexuses become powerful in their own right. 

Linus Torvalds is a git (if you think I'm being offensive you haven't searched 'git' recently) fortunately for his sanity he has managed to clone himself on a distributed network, has created evermore collaborative working practices. In fact this document is maintained with git with incremental versions.






The Irony of Post-Modernism
===========================



The Last Days of Modernity and the Further Days of Nexity
===========================================================

The main failing of modernity is a cultural insensitivity while corroding tradition. However many times modernity reinvents itself for the purposes of cultural acceptance, it remains a rigid vision. Nexity is a fluid challenge to traditions but ultimately maintainable with support of cultural practitioners and admirers of diversity.
